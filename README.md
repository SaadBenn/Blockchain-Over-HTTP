# Blockchain-Over-HTTP

This is a simplified version of Blockchain which uses the `Flask` framework to interact with it.

## About Flask Framework
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. Applications that use the `Flask` framework include **Pinterest**, **LinkedIn**, and the community web page for Flask itself. 

Please [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)) for more info on `Flask`.

## Flask Framework
We are using three endpoints to use the Blockchain as our API.
1. `/transactions/new`
2. `/mine`
3. `/chain`
